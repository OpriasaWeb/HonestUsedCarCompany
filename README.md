# Honest Ralph's Used Car Comapny

A. Honest Ralph's Used Car Company allows customers to purchase cars over a 24-month period by making 24 equal payments and charging no interest. Design an application that gets customer data, including an account number, customer name, and purchase price. Output the account number and name, then output the customer's projected balance each month for the next 24 months after the payment is made.

B. Modify the car payment application so it executes continuosly for any number of customers until a sentinel value is supplied for the account number.
